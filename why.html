        <h3>But, why?</h3>
        <p>
            This started as a school project. I needed to make an app and a website to go along with it. We had freedom to do whatever we wanted, and 
            since I was very much interested in machine learning at the time, I figured I would do an app that would read the equation using OCR, and then 
            solve it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later on, when I started making the app, I realized how horribly bad the OCR is at recognizing symbols.

            Even huge symbols were misinterpreted or not even interpreted.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a while, I got an idea to create a solver for the "worded" equations. Where numbers and operators are written in words, such as "TWENTY" and "MINUS".
            OCR was much better at interpreting equations in this format.

        <p>
            And so I found a way to parse "word" numbers into their digit form, and I wrote a simple algorithm to parse the OCR output and solve the equation.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, the created app could be called a gimmick, useless, but it was fun, and it worked quite well.
